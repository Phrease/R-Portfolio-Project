Experience
Project 1: Colorado Rent Burden and Median Household Income Analysis

Sourced, cleaned, and merged multi-year datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) for all Colorado counties.

Leveraged R (dplyr, sf) to calculate rent burden (percentage of income spent on rent) and analyze the statistical relationship between median household income and housing costs.

Developed and presented a series of choropleth maps using ggplot2, visualizing the geographic disparities in rent burden and identifying counties where affordability is a critical issue.

Findings were compiled into a report for a local housing advocacy group to support data-driven policy recommendations.

Project 2: Colorado Tornado Activity Analysis

Analyzed historical tornado data from NOAA's Storm Prediction Center database, focusing on occurrences within Colorado from 1950 to the present.

Used R (dplyr) to process and aggregate the data by county, intensity (EF-Scale), and time of year.

Created a heatmap with ggplot2 to visualize tornado frequency and intensity across different counties, identifying a high-risk corridor in the eastern plains.

The analysis was summarized in a presentation for a regional risk assessment, highlighting key trends and vulnerable areas.
