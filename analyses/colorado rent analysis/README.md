Project Overview
This project aims to identify economic trends and disparities among Colorado's counties. By analyzing publicly available data on employment, income, and population, I sought to answer key questions about the region's economic landscape. The goal was to use data visualization to tell a clear story about which counties are thriving and what factors might be contributing to their success.

Key questions explored:

Which counties have seen the most significant economic growth over the past five years?

Is there a correlation between population density and median income in Colorado?

Data Source
The dataset was sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment. The data covers the years 2018-2023 and was joined to create a comprehensive view of each county.

Tools and Libraries
Language: R

Libraries: tidycensus, tidyverse, sf, ggplot2, viridis, scales

Tools: RStudio, Git, GitHub

Key Findings
A few of the key insights from the analysis include:

A data visualization of median household income highlighted key areas of economic strength and potential areas for development in the Northern and Eastern Plains.
